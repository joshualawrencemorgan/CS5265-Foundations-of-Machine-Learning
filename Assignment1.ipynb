        "# Capital Bikeshare Membership Prediction and Rider Preference\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "Bikeshare programs in large cities offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly mode of transportation for citizens and tourists. The bike docks that are integral to these programs can collect a number of data points about each ride. Research has been conducted by the [Department of Transportation](https://data.bts.gov/stories/s/Summary-of-Docked-Bikeshare-Trips-by-System-and-Ot/7fgy-2zkf/) on the total usage of bikeshare programs and the membership numbers of the program, but extensive research into the differences between casual and member riders has not been conducted. I want to use the data provided by the bikeshare program in Washington, D.C., Capital Bikeshare, to build a model that can predict, based on the characteristics of a ride, whether that ride was made by a member (a rider with an annual subscription) or a non-member.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Description\n",
        "This project seeks to learn more about the behaviors of bikeshare users by creating a membership prediction model for Capital Bikeshare (CaBi). The analysis is conducted on user trip data from [August 2023 rides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html) provided by Capital Bikeshare.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Performance Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy - Can the model correctly predict whether a ride was taken by a member or a casual rider? This will involve training against a dataset and comparing the model's determination against the data from Capital Bikeshare.\n",
        "\n",
        "Characteristics - Which characteristics of a ride are more important for members? Using the model, is it possible to identify attributes of a ride that are more common among members.\n"
